I replaced classical positional embedding of original hkproj/pytorch-transformer (https://github.com/hkproj/pytorch-transformer.git) with rotary embedding of  lucidrains/rotary-embedding-torch (https://github.com/lucidrains/rotary-embedding-torch.git) and confirmed languge translation trainig improves significantly.
